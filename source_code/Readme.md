# Instructions
    To load model, it should be named according to the pattern LOSSFUNCTION_model_DATASET
    where DATASET is either of 3Dshapes,mnist, or dsprites
    LOSSFUNCTION is either betavae (for all loss variations except joint-vae and vade), vade, jointvae.

    type --help for argument passing
